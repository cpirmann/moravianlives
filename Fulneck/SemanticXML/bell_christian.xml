					February 1772
					Christian Bell was born in London Dec<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
					1742 and came as a little Boy into the Children&apos;s
					Oeconomy, he was a very lovely Child, beloved by all
					about him. When he arrived to his Boys Age, he
					was put apprentice to our dear late B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charlesworth
					in the Merchant Business, during which time be
					behaved himself as an orderly &amp; faithful Apprentices,
					and gave full Satisfaction to B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charlesworth &amp; others
					about him. I was evident that there was a Work
					of Grace in his Heart, be those who were acquainted
					with him were in Hopes that he would not only prosper
					&amp; become a happy Brother, but that he would also be
					useful in our Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> kingdom, In these Years he was
					very openhearted &amp; seemed to have no other Concern than
					to be formed by our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> quite according to his Mind &amp;
					to live for His alone in the World.</p>
					<p>
					The was received into the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> April 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1754 &amp; on
					August 29<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1762 he was rec&apos;d into the Single B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> Choir
					March 27<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1766 he was admitted to the holy Com-
					munion, but which had not the wished for Effect. Soon
					after he went to London where the Snares laid for him
					caught a surprizing Hold of him &amp; a love to the World

					took place in him, so that his Soul rec&apos;d a Hurt at this
					Time which was never rightly cured again till a little
					while before his Departure.</p>
					<p>
					After he set up Business for himself, it obliged him
					&amp; to make some Journeys to London, where Temptations
					were renewed, to draw him altogether into the World, and
					altho&apos; the Staff of Corruption &amp; strong tendencies thereto
					lay in him, yet he felt such Strong Convictions, that he
					never could come to a Resolution to go into the World,
					yet this divided Heart &amp; continual Struggle betwixt our
					Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; the World caused him a heavy &amp; truly unhappy Life
					that one could not see and speak with him without being
					moved with compassion. A Times he was much concerned
					about his unhappy State of Heart &amp; wished our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
					might attain his Aim with him; he also was some times
					very sensibly Struck with the strong proofs he had of our 
					Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Faithfulness to him &amp; by seeing how He kept his Hand
					over Him. This had the effect upon him that he once in
					a particular Manner pray&apos;d our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> if He saw no other
					way of obtaining his Aim with him to do it by giving him
						a sickly Habit of Body, <add place="above">or taking him to himself</add> rather than suffer him to go into
					the World, &amp; he has often considered our Sv<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Dealings with
					him as an Answer to this Prayer. 
					About a half a Year ago, as he was going to Leeds &amp; had still thoughts of pursuing a Worldly Scheme, tho&apos; with much uneasiness of Mind &amp; Having pray&apos;d as
						above, he stop&apos;d &amp; looked back for his Company when he got a Vomiting of blood, which was the beginning of his last Sickness.</p>
					<p>
					About 2 months ago it was observed that his tender				
			</p>
			<p>

					and weakly Constitution turned into a Consumption &amp;
					he declined very fast. He was frequently visited by
					many B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi>, for he was generally beloved, &amp; when it drew
					nearer his End that he himself begun to think, he
					would soon go home, he spoke with great concern, to 
					Some of the Labourers whom he had most Confidence
					in &amp; had been best acquainted with, and Lamented
					that he had spend much of his Time so poorly with Rea
					soning, Reading unprofitable Books, neglecting the
					Meetings &amp; other privileges of the Congregation, he
					also said that he never had experienced the true Grace
					in the Blood &amp; Merits of Christ <add place="above">as a poor</add> <hi rend="strikethrough">our Saviour</hi> Sinner.</p>
					<p>
					<hi rend="underline">This brought him into such Distress that he thought</hi>
					he would be lost. Two Nights before his Departure,
					<add place="above">and being</add> <hi rend="strikethrough">when he was</hi> yet pretty strong, he wept &amp; prayed all
					the Night thro&apos; <add place="above">and got</add> <hi rend="strikethrough">when he</hi> also <hi rend="strikethrough">got</hi> Comfort from our
					Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. From that Time his Fear was gone &amp; he longed
					to go to our Sav<hi rend="strikethrough">r</hi>. which was on the 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of Feb<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, the same
					Evening he sat up a long while &amp; conversed with 2 B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi>
					in a bandlike way in the heartiest &amp; very agreeable
					Manner. He also kept a very openhearted Band with
					a Labourer 2 days before. He himself thought
					he should continue about 3 weeks longer, but the

					Night betwixt the 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> &amp; 7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of Fcbruary, he all at
					once began to hasten, &amp; when his Choir Labourer
					came to him at 5 in the Morning he asked him, if
					he had got full forgiveness from our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, &amp; if he
					now was longing to go to Him, both he answered in
					the Affirmive. A few Minutes after it was
					observed that the happy moment approached. He
					was blessed &amp; turned pale during the Verse: When in
					the Armes of Jesus etc. accompanied with a sweet
					feeling of Grace in the 30 Year of his Age.
