					Departed May the 9<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1761
					The Youth John Morgan was born at Kensington near London
					May the 26<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1743. He came to the Childn<hi rend="superscript">s</hi> Oeconomy at Bullermeer
					when he was about 3 Years old, and came from thence with the
					whole Oeconomy to Smith house in 1749. During his childhood he
					had a promising Genius and Capacity for learning, and in his
					disposition had something pretty and taking, but with regard to
					his heart there always appeard a tendency to being close, and re
					serv&apos;d, which often made his Brn sigh, least in futurity the same
					should continue and consequently prove detrimental to his Boys and
					Youths course in the Congn
				</p>
				<p>
					About the time of the Oeconomies removing from Smith house
					to Lambshill in 1753 there often appeared something of the dear Mo
					thers Labour upon his Heart, particularly when his curiosity of which 
					he had a great share led him upon searching into things which he was
					afterwards shy in speaking about. In this course he went on, and 
					his Br<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> were often very mich distressed on his Account, and full of
					fears lest his want of uprightness and openness would make his course
					heavy to himself and painful to our Saviour &amp; this Br<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> he had how
					every Intervals betwixt, sometimes dear and promising &amp; then again
					dark and gloomy, particularly if any thing manifestly appeared against
					him on account of which he should become a Sinner. However he
					applied himself with exemplary Diligence to writing Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> Accounts,
					and showed a certain pleasure in doing whatsoever was committed to
					him with great faithfulness and punctuallity.
				</p>
				<p>
					He was receiv&apos;d into the great Boys choir Jan<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> 9, 1797 by B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Renatus
					which seemingly had a blessed effect upon him for a long time af
					ter, but his close disposition of Mind caused him many anxious
					moments, when he heard he should be spoke with seprately, and he sel
					dom returned from it but with red and wet Eyes on Account thereof.
					He came to live in the Choir-house and learn the shoema
					kers business August the 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> 1758, His diligence at his Work and
					desire to learn the business thoroughly was pleasing to every

					one who had to do with him but he laboured under an impedi
					ment in his Eyesight which often pain&apos;d him and made him dis
					pair sometimes of ever learning to work as he should do
				</p>
				<p>
					In Nov<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 1759 he was one of those Youth when our dear Johannes
					has been very orderly ever since he came into the choirhouse,
					always showing Obedience to his Br<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> and esteeming that as highly 
					necessary both in himself and others. Those 3 or 4 Months past
					he has been much more concern&apos;d for a lively Heart, and spoke
					of it with more feeling than formerly, was also more clear and open
					&amp; had a more real connexion with our Savr. In the begining of his 
					Sickness which was towards the latter end of April, he did not think
					much of going home, nor did he desire it much because his heart
					was not in so tender to situation towards our Savr as it could &amp;
					should be. Several serious bands were kept with him, whereby
					he discovered a sensibility not observed in him before. The
					5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Instant he altered, told a Labourer he knew he was much
					concern&apos;d on his Account, and not without Reason, for said he
					my heart has not been so lively as it should, but be not distress&apos;d
					or troubled about me, perhaps you may think it would not be agre
					able to me to go home, but I can ease you on that Account, and
					assure you my concern comes not from that Corner, whenever he calls
					me he will take one to himself, I am his &amp; shall certainly go to
					him, this is a clear and made out matter to me, but my concern 
					is that my heart is not more lively and warm &amp; that I have not
					enjoy&apos;d his precious nearness as I could and should have done.
					This Conversation was sattisfactory. He also spoke with our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
					from that time in a more Sinnerlike but confident manner
					as long as he was able to speak, &amp; also told his Labourers and other
					Brn he now knew he should go home this time express&apos;d also
					a desire after it. At last it was very difficult for him to speak
					but when visited did all in his power to render himself intelligible
			</p>
			<p>
					and particularly to express himself about going home. The 7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
					in the Morning he expressed again his desire to go home so as to 
					be understood, &amp; about 11 at Night his Sickness took such a turn
					that it was thought he would go directly.
				</p>
				<p>
					From this time he took very little notice of any person or thing
					about him but lay quite still seemingly without pain till the 9<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
					(that ever memorable day) in the evening while the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> was
					enjoying the holy Communion, about 1/2 an hour before his de
					parture he came quite to himself, was very sensible of his pain,
					but not able to speak, &amp; 3/4 past 9 while the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> prostrated
					he was deliverd into the hands of his Redeemer in a peculiar
					tender manner, to whom he breathed out his spirit with the bles
					sing of his Choir, &amp; during the singing of several Verses in
					his 18<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Year
