The Life of Br Benjamin Sheard
who has wrote the following of him self
I was born it Littletown in the Parish of Birstal
Novr 30th 1715 my Parents beeing Presbeterians,
I was Baptised, & brought up in the Same Religion
when I was about 16 Years of Age my Corruption
got the mastery over me, and let me in to all manner
of amusements as Singing & Dancing and the
pleasures of this world, which I pursued with my
Whole Heart for 3 Years, which was a great Grief
to my Parents, they admonishd me many times 
to leave of this ways, but all was to no purpose
for I found I could not help my self. In April
1734 I was Married with my wife at Birstal
Church. In 1738 I had Some Conversation
with a man who told me how he had been awaken-
end, and what Distress he had been in & had
our Saviour had delivered him, he lent me
a Book to read, called the Young mans Guide
upon which I begun to read, & to pray & to reform
my Life, but the happy change did not last
long, but I fell soon in to my old course again
untill the Year 1739 when Mr Ingham begun
to preach and Settled Societys I went to hear
him, but I felt such a Condemnation in my heart
thinking my day of Grace was past & that there
was no mercy for me, In this situation I remained
for Some time, but at last our Saviour gave


me a Gracious Look and Refreshed my poor heart
In this happy feeling I went on for Some time, I got 
more & more acquainted with the Brn which proved
a great Blessing to my heart, but when I began to
think well of my self I lost that happy feeling and
became dry in my heart, but my dear Saviour
Shewed me my deviation and I crept to Him
as a Sinner, March 20 1750 I and my wife
had the Grace & favour to be Received in to the 
Congregation at Fulneck, which was a real
Blessing for my poor heart, there I felt that
our dear Saviour watched in the midst of
His Congregation, and that I was one of His 
Family, Some times I wept on account of
my faults & wants and Some times my
heart near melted with mercy & forgiveness.
In our married state our Saviour has
Blesed us with 12 children 6 sons &
6 Daughters, all are gone before me
Except 2 daughters who are under the
Care of the Congregation, with my wife I 
have lived happy and agreeable.

with great patience He was however able
to follow his Bussness, & come to the chapel
