					<l>The Life of Br Benjamin Sheard</l>
					<l>who has wrote the following of him self</l>
					<l>I was born it Littletown in the Parish of Birstal</l>
					<l>Novr 30th 1715 my Parents beeing Presbeterians,</l>
					<l>I was Baptised, &amp; brought up in the Same Religion</l>
					<l>when I was about 16 Years of Age my Corruption</l>
					<l>got the mastery over me, and let me in to all manner</l>
					<l>of amusements as Singing &amp; Dancing and the</l>
					<l>pleasures of this world, which I pursued with my</l>
					<l>Whole Heart for 3 Years, which was a great Grief</l>
					<l>to my Parents, they admonishd me many times </l>
					<l>to leave of this ways, but all was to no purpose</l>
					<l>for I found I could not help my self. In April</l>
					<l>1734 I was Married with my wife at Birstal</l>
					<l>Church. In 1738 I had Some Conversation</l>
					<l>with a man who told me how he had been awaken-</l>
					<l>end, and what Distress he had been in &amp; had</l>
					<l>our Saviour had delivered him, he lent me</l>
					<l>a Book to read, called the Young mans Guide</l>
					<l>upon which I begun to read, &amp; to pray &amp; to reform</l>
					<l>my Life, but the happy change did not last</l>
					<l>long, but I fell soon in to my old course again</l>
					<l>untill the Year 1739 when Mr Ingham begun</l>
					<l>to preach and Settled Societys I went to hear</l>
					<l>him, but I felt such a Condemnation in my heart</l>
					<l>thinking my day of Grace was past &amp; that there</l>
					<l>was no mercy for me, In this situation I remained</l>
					<l>for Some time, but at last our Saviour gave</l>

			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>me a Gracious Look and Refreshed my poor heart</l>
					<l>In this happy feeling I went on for Some time, I got </l>
					<l>more &amp; more acquainted with the Brn which proved</l>
					<l>a great Blessing to my heart, but when I began to</l>
					<l>think well of my self I lost that happy feeling and</l>
					<l>became dry in my heart, but my dear Saviour</l>
					<l>Shewed me my deviation and I crept to Him</l>
					<l>as a Sinner, March 20 1750 I and my wife</l>
					<l>had the Grace &amp; favour to be Received in to the </l>
					<l>Congregation at Fulneck, which was a real</l>
					<l>Blessing for my poor heart, there I felt that</l>
					<l>our dear Saviour watched in the midst of</l>
					<l>His Congregation, and that I was one of His </l>
					<l>Family, Some times I wept on account of</l>
					<l>my faults &amp; wants and Some times my</l>
					<l>heart near melted with mercy &amp; forgiveness.</l>
					<l>In our married state our Saviour has</l>
					<l>Blesed us with 12 children 6 sons &amp;</l>
					<l>6 Daughters, all are gone before me</l>
					<l>Except 2 daughters who are under the</l>
					<l>Care of the Congregation, with my wife I </l>
					<l>have lived happy and agreeable.</l>
					<l>So far his own writings.</l>
					<l>He partook of the Lords Suepnes the first time</l>
					<l>with the Congrn Sept 19th 1750. He became</l>
					<l>an Acoluth of the Brethrens church in August</l>
					<l>1767, and he was one of our Comittee Brethren</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>He was much beloved by his Brn &amp; Sisters</l>
					<l>and by his Neighboors as a Man of God</l>
					<l>he had a tender heart to our dear Saviour</l>
					<l>and took, share in the weal &amp; was</l>
					<l>of the Congregation. And he was Little</l>
					<l>&amp; mean in his own Eyes.</l>
					<l>he has been troubled with an Asthmatich</l>
					<l>Disorder for Several Years, which he bore</l>
					<l>with great patience He was however able</l>
					<l>to follow his Bussness, &amp; come to the chapel</l>
					<l>till a few weeks before his End, he was</l>
					<l>chearfully Resignd to his dear Savr</l>
					<l>on the 5th of Septr Br Hauptman</l>
					<l>had a very chearful &amp; loving Conversation</l>
					<l>with him about being ready, &amp; without</l>
					<l>fear when our dear Lord calls one</l>
					<l>but no one did think that his End was</l>
					<l>So near, for on the 7th in the afternoon</l>
					<l>he got permission to leave his mortal</l>
					<l>Tent in the 59th Year of his age.</l>
