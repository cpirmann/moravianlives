					<l>Depd Aug. 3d 1761</l>
					<l>Edmund Tattersalls Course of Life, the Part of which was noted</l>
					<l>down from his own Mouth </l>
					<l>I was born (in Heyroid, Worley Township) in ye Parish of Hallifax 5/16 Oct. 1691</l>
					<l>(and baptized in my fathers house by a Church Minister)</l>
					<l>My Father departed this Life when I was 6 Years old. My Mother</l>
					<l>took the Tuition of me, because of a small Estate which I had to expect.</l>
					<l>I was sent to School till I was 10 Years old &amp; learnd to read &amp; write</l>
					<l>Afterwards I was put out Apprentice to a Clothier for 10 Years, and saw</l>
					<l>and heard nothing but wickedness &amp; Irreligion. Being free from my</l>
					<l>Prenticeship I married and followed the Worsted Trade and lead a </l>
					<l>loose Life of Idleness and Drunkiness &amp; The People &amp; Servants which I </l>
					<l>employed proved bad and unfaithfull, &amp; I was forced to give up Busi-</l>
					<l>ness, designing to go to ye Isle of Man, to a Brother in Law &amp; there to</l>
					<l>was follow my Trade afresh, was already on Board the Vessel, but was three 2 times</l>
					<l>brought back because of the Rebellion in England at that time. After the</l>
					<l>Battle at Preston I came back again &amp; settled in Hallifax &amp; wove</l>
					<l>resolved to break of from my former wicked Course and to become re-</l>
					<l>ligious. I had strong Convictions in my Mind &amp; prayed often, but without</l>
					<l>understanding. Once I came amongst some Soldiers who wanted</l>
					<l>being</l>
					<l>to trick me putting money into my pocket, but I a desperate</l>
					<l>Fellow, got off from them. Half a Year after I went as a Volunteer among</l>
					<l>the Kings Dragoons left my wife and Childrn, but staid only 13 weeks</l>
					<l>and then got my Discharge again. Two Years after I listed in ye</l>
					<l>same Reigment &amp; staid again no longer then 13 weeks, because I saw so much wicked</l>
					<l>ness &amp; got at length my Dismission, which I desired. I returned to</l>
					<l>my wife and Children and followed my Trade weaving in Hallifax. It was</l>
					<l>at this time that I earnestly sought to become religious, went</l>
					<l>every Month to the Communiun in the Church &amp; entred into a So</l>
					<l>ciety with some Churchmen who in principles were Calvinists</l>
					<l>with them I continued till I was 49 Years old. At that time I was</l>
					<l>seized with a violent fever &amp; during that Sickness I found that </l>
					<l>I was not in a State of being saved Salvation, I had not that Satisfaction</l>
					<l>and rest, which I thought I had. I recognized from that Illess</l>
					<l>and resolved to join no Party, untill I was better Satisfied in</l>
					<l>my Soul. When the Brn came to keep Meetings at the Worlds End</l>
				</lg>

			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>near Hallifax I went to hear them, liked them well, desired also to</l>
					<l>be in their Society, which was granted the 21 Jan.</l>
					<l>Amongst the Brethren and in their Preaching I found that wch</l>
					<l>I wanted I loved them exceedingly, because I was convinced</l>
					<l>that ye Lord was with them, I spared no time nor pain to</l>
					<l>go to hear them and to accompany them from place to</l>
					<l>place &amp; discoursed with them, being mostly concerned for abt points</l>
					<l>of doctrine. My wife would not go with me at first, because</l>
					<l>she had not much hopes, that I would continue, being so</l>
					<l>cross &amp; peevish with her, for I was of a proud nature and want-</l>
					<l>ted to be Something.</l>
					<l>From that the time that he was joined be ye Brn our Savrs Word con-</l>
					<l>cerning his Death &amp; Passion often reached his heart, but his</l>
					<l>pride &amp; seeking to fill his head with Knowledge long stifled his our</l>
					<l>dr Savr Work long; he was also of a very talkative Disposition </l>
					<l>and preached to every one in his family &amp; to others, so that</l>
					<l>to became burdensome to his wife and Child: &amp; to every body</l>
					<l>besides whereby he did had hurt to himself and others</l>
					<l>they saw that his Spirit &amp; conversation was not agreeing.</l>
					<l>His Labourers told him for of it and he was glad and thank-</l>
					<l>full for their reproofs but he could not help himself &amp;c. He</l>
					<l>often melted into Tears and confessed his follies to the Brn</l>
					<l>His heart grew more and more attached to the wounded Savr &amp; he</l>
					<l>felt himself overcome by his Dying Love, wished &amp; earnsstly</l>
					<l>entreated to be under the special Care of the Br &amp; to be in a</l>
					<l>Member of the Congrn which also was granted on the 13 Aug</l>
					<l>1749. as Gracehill Lambs Hill he was exceeding glad of it, delighted to</l>
					<l>come in coming to the Meetings, and in Conversation with to converse with the Brn</l>
					<l>and went on chearfully &amp; happy, was beloved much by the Brn</l>
					<l>and loved them as our Savrs peculiar chosen Inheritance</l>
					<l>He was made a Partaker of the holy Comunion June 17th 1750</l>
					<l>He hasten These many Years he was troubled these many Yrs with an Asthmatic Disorder</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>which encreased more &amp; more, so that it became very troublesome to</l>
					<l>him to walk &amp; attend the Meetings. Hewever as long as he could</l>
					<l>creep he would not stay away miss coming for said he nothing is such a</l>
					<l>Comfort for my heart Soul and Body than as hear of my of cruci-</l>
					<l>fied Lamb and to be in fellowship with my dr Brn. The holy</l>
					<l>Sacrament was to him the highest Festival, which if he could help heÂ </l>
					<l>would never miss. He borrowd last March was a twelve month a Galloway to</l>
					<l>come to Wike, but so was a good while after so sore in his Limbs, that</l>
					<l>he could come no more. Aug the 4 he was the last time at the</l>
					<l>Starary in Hallifax at the Quarterly Meeting &amp; received at night his Share</l>
					<l>with some others in the holy Sacramt, he tried Sept 2 to come</l>
					<l>once more, but was obliged on acct of Illness to go home again</l>
					<l>and from that time his Disorder turnd into a Dropsy his Legs be-</l>
					<l>gan to swell &amp; at last to break &amp; run wch continued ever since. He could not</l>
					<l>lie in Bed, but sat in a Choir by ye fire Side. Our dr &amp; gracious</l>
					<l>Savr took him now into a peculiar school, which was beneficial to his heart, but</l>
					<l>Dec 16 last Yr when I was with him and the newly published Christian Magazin</l>
					<l>of a man was mentioned he said. I look upon Mount Olive &amp; Calvary with</l>
					<l>my Lord did penance for me and the rest of Man all mankind &amp; hung as a Lamb</l>
					<l>on the Cross wounded all over to be the best Magazin and Storehouse</l>
					<l>of for a Christian, I want to know nothing but Him in his dying form</l>
					<l>He was very glad whenever Brn came to see him, &amp; this was done as </l>
					<l>often as it could be. Febr. Last Febr. he complained much of his Pain</l>
					<l>&amp; Distress, in Body, but above all a Dryness in his heart &amp; that he had</l>
					<l>not a feeling Sense of the Saviours precious Nearness, and wept fore</l>
					<l>on account of his Impatience and Peevishness. March 10 he kept an </l>
					<l>open hearted Band with me and told me, that our Savr was so gra-</l>
					<l>cious as to help him, in his great outward Poverty, he was ashamed</l>
					<l>more of himself than he was did not more relying more upon him &amp; was not thankfull</l>
					<l>to him enough for all the manifest Proofs of his Loving heart. He</l>
					<l>fell sometimes into reasoning thoughts that he was a Burden to every</l>
					<l>one &amp; wished that our Savr might grant him to be dissolved his dissolution.</l>
					<l>I told him, that all these things wch he complaind of arose from one cause</l>
					<l>He should speak thoroughly with our dr Savr abt the state of his heart and beg a drop</l>
					<l>of his ll healing Blood for his Soul, &amp; that the Spirit of Jesus shd take full Possession</l>
				</lg>

			<pb xml:id='IMG_1694.jpg' n='3'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>of his heart and that he shd make a blessed use of this blessed Passion Season. His</l>
					<l>wife had been his Nurse and dressed his running Legs till the 27 th </l>
					<l>of April when she by a Paralysis of the ?? was disabled &amp; confined to this</l>
					<l>bed, which made his case still nore pitiable &amp; distressed. He</l>
					<l>could have no relief granted from the Parish, but what some chari-</l>
					<l>table persons did in consideration of the greatest poverty to which they</l>
					<l>were reduced to. They were visited at least every fortnight, &amp;</l>
					<l>many an openhearted Conversation kept with them both, which</l>
					<l>proved always a Blessing &amp; Comfort to them, especially June 23</l>
					<l>&amp; July 7, when they both after having they had been spoken with fully,</l>
					<l>received their share in the holy Comuni Sacrament on their Sick-</l>
					<l>bed. I was these several months quite pleased with the State of</l>
					<l>his heart, he grew weaker &amp; weaker in Body, his Legs began</l>
					<l>to heal in part and our dr Saviour made a blessed End of all</l>
					<l>his Trouble Grief &amp; Woes by taking him home to himself Aug.</l>
					<l>the 3d in the forenoon at 11 ocl. when the Text was Lazarus</l>
					<l>our friend Sleepeth. He had groaned in his dying Tabernacle</l>
					<l>69 Years 10 Months &amp; 17 days. His Corpse had a lovely, sweet</l>
					<l>aspect bespeaking the happy sleep &amp; Rest wch he had entered into.</l>
